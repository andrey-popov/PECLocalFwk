/**
 * \class PileUpWeight
 * \brief Plugin that implements reweighting for additional pp interactions ("pile-up")
 * 
 * This plugin performs reweighting on pile-up based on the expected number of pile-up
 * interactions, or "true" simulated pile-up. The idea follows the official recipe [1].
 * 
 * The input parameters for the algorithm are a file with the target (data) distribution of pile-up
 * (normally this file is created by script pileupCalc.py [2]) and an amount of scaling of the
 * number of pile-up interactions that is used to account for the systematical variation (as
 * described in [3]).
 * 
 * In past there were problems with the random-number engine exploited to admix pile-up to MC,
 * which made the actual pile-up distribution in MC deviate from the nominal one. This plugin is
 * capable of handling such cases, allowing user to supply a ROOT file with actual pile-up MC
 * histograms, which are then used instead of nominal one.
 * 
 * The nominal MC pile-up distribution used by default is Startup2015 for 25 ns (adopted in
 * RunIISpring15DR74-Asympt25ns).
 * 
 * This plugin exploits a PileUpReader with the default name "PileUp".

     * The first argument is the name of a file containing "true" data distribution over number
     * of pile-up interactions. The file must contain a histogram named "pileup" that describes
     * the distribution. No assumption about binning of the histogram is made (the code works
     * with any one). The second parameter is the name of a file with MC distributions over the
     * "true" number of pile-up interactions before any event selection (it might differ from
     * the nominal distribution due to a bug in random-number engine). The both file names are
     * resolved w.r.t. directory $PEC_FWK_INSTALL/data/PileUp/. The last parameter is a
     * desired systematical variation as defined in [1].
