 * \class StdBTaggerPlugin
 * \brief Wraps the standard b-tagging into a plugin
 * 
 * A concrete implementation of BTaggerPlugin that simply wraps the standard class to perform
 * b-tagging into a plugin. The user is expected to use this class only to complement another
 * non-trivial implementation of BTaggerPlugin. If, instead, there is no specific need in that
 * class and only standard b-tagging is exploited, the user is advised to use the BTagger class.
