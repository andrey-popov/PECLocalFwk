/**
 * \class WeightBTag
 * \brief Implements a reweighting to account for b-tagging scale factors
 * 
 * Reweighting is performed according to a recipe described in [1]. Tag configuration is not
 * affected, i.e. if a jet is b-tagged, it stays b-tagged after the reweighting is applied.
 * [1] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/BTagSFMethods#1a_Event_reweighting_using_scale
 * 
 * An instance of this class contains unique copies of objects to access b-tagging efficiencies and
 * scale factors. On the other hand, the object to perform b-tagging is shared among all copies of
 * *this.
 * 
 * The class is copyable, movable, non-assignable, and it is not thread-safe.
