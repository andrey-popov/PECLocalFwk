/**
 * \class EventIDFilter
 * \brief Filters events based on their ID
 * 
 * This plugin filters events based on their ID (run, lumi, event numbers). The user specifies a
 * list of event IDs in a text file, and the plugin either keeps or rejects events whose IDs are
 * found in the list.
 * 
 * The filter relies on the presence of a EventIDReader with a default name "EventID".
 * 
 * \warning The class can filter atomic datasets only (i.e. ones that contain a single file).
