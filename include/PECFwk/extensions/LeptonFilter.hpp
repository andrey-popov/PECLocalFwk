/**
 * \class LeptonFilter
 * \brief Filter to perform event selection based on basic kinematic properties of leptons
 * 
 * The user defines the selection with a set of selection bins. Each bin specifies pt and |eta|
 * requirements for a given lepton flavour. A bin is added for every lepton whose presence is
 * required by the event selection. An event is accepted if for every bin there is at least one
 * compatible tight lepton, the total number of selected tight leptons equals the number of bins,
 * and there are no additional loose leptons.
 * 
 * For instance, a selection asking for two muons with pt > 20 GeV/c and |eta| < 2.1, one of them
 * having pt > 26 GeV/c, can be constructed with the following commands:
 *   AddSelectionBin(Lepton::Flavour::Muon, 20., 2.1);
 *   AddSelectionBin(Lepton::Flavour::Muon, 26., 2.1);
 * 
 * The filter relies on the presence of a LeptonReader. The default name is "Leptons".
