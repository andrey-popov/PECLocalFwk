 * counts those that are b-tagged according to the provided algorithm and working point. The event
 * is accepted if these two multiplicities fall into one of 2D regions of acceptance (selection
 * bins)provided by the user.

 * The filter relies on the presence of a JetMETReader and a BTagWPService. The default names are
