/**
 * \class BTagWPService
 * \brief A class to perform b-tagging
 * 
 * The class provides methods to check if a jet is b-tagged. Although the check can be performed
 * for any supported working point, short-cuts that use a default working point are provided. In
 * addition, the class declares enumerations to specify b-tagging algorithm and working point; they
 * are expected to be used in other classes related to b-tagging.
 * 
 * It is recommended that b-tagging is performed by the means of this class only but never using
 * values of b-tagging discriminators provided by class Jet.
 * 
 * The class provides valid copy and move constructors and assignment operator. Is is thread-safe.
