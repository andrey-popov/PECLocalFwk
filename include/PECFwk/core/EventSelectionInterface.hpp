/**
 * \class EventSelectionInterface
 * \brief An abstract class to define an offline event selection
 * 
 * This abstract class defines an interface to specify an event selection. It is not allowed to
 * access quality of objects, which is to be addressed in class PECReader. Instead, it bases the
 * event selection on simple kinematic information stored in PhysicsObjects classes.
 * 
 * The event selection is two-step: leptons are addressed first, then jets. Currently there is no
 * way to define QCD control region, see some thoughts here [1].
 * [1] https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/singletop/wiki/PECReaderNotes
 * 
 * When several instances of class PECReader are run in parallel, each one is expected to operate
 * its own copy of the class in order to guarantee thread safety and allow derived classes to store
 * cached information if needed. The copy is created by method Clone, which must be implemented by
 * the user.
 * 
 * The class is copyable.
