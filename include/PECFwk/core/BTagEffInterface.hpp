/**
 * \class BTagEffInterface
 * \brief An abstract base class for accessing b-tagging efficiencies
 * 
 * The class defines an interface for a class to retrieve b-tagging efficiencies. A derived class
 * must provide meaningful implementations for methods to read a payload with b-tagging efficiencies
 * and calculate the efficiency for a given jet.
 * 
 * Since it is common to operate with a single working point only, the class provides means to
 * specify default working point and a more convenient accessor to b-tagging efficiency which uses
 * it.
 * 
 * One instance of a derived class is expected to communicate with one thread only. Nevertheless,
 * several instances can share same resources, e.g. a file with b-tagging efficiencies, and special
 * protection might be needed.
