/**
 * \class Dataset
 * \brief A class to store information about a dataset
 * 
 * The class aggregates all relevant information about a dataset. It includes names of ROOT files,
 * corresponding cross sections and numbers of events in the parent datasets processed in Grid. It
 * also attaches one or more codes to specify physics process represendted by the dataset. If
 * several process codes are provided, they describe the process at different levels of
 * detalisation, e.g. ttbar and semileptonic ttbar; they are never scrict synonyms. In addition,
 * information about generators of the hard process and the showering can be specified.
 * 
 * Moreover, the user can define arbitrary boolean flags binded with an instance of the class. Their
 * usage is not governed by the framework.
