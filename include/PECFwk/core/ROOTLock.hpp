/**
 * \class ROOTLock
 * \brief Provides a lock to protect thread-unsafe ROOT routines
 * 
 * The class is a simple wrapper around a static mutex. Since ROOT is not thread-safe, this lock
 * must be used to mark all the crical blocks of code that call ROOT routines. In particular,
 * creation of any ROOT objects must be guarded with the help of this class. The user should also
 * keep in mind that threads share the current ROOT directory object (gDirectory).
