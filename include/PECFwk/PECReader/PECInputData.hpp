/**
 * \class PECInputData
 * \brief Opens files in PEC format
 * 
 * The plugin opens files in a dataset in PEC format. It only reads the tree with event ID,
 * exploiting it also to judge when there are no more events in an input file. Other plugins can
 * request it to extract trees from the file.
 * 
 * Currently the framework does not provide an elegant way to notify other plugins when a new file
 * is opened. This is a problem because dependant plugins much update their pointers to trees and
 * set up branch addresses whenever a new input file is opened. However, the framework typically
 * operates with atomic datasets, so this should not be a large problem. For the time being,
 * reading of multiple files in a dataset is disabled; only the first file will be read.
