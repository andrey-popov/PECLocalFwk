/**
 * \class PECJetMETReader
 * \brief Provides reconstructed jets and MET
 * 
 * This plugin reads reconstructed jets and MET from a PEC file, with the help of a PECInputData
 * plugin, and translates them to standard classes used by the framework. User can specify a
 * kinematic selection to be applied to jets, using method SetSelection. By default, jets are
 * cleaned against tight leptons produced by a LeptonReader with name "Leptons". This behaviour
 * can be configured with method ConfigureLeptonCleaning.
 * 
 * If the name of a plugin that reads generator-level jets is provided with the help of the method
 * SetGenJetReader, angular matching to them is performed. The maximal allowed angular distance for
 * matching is set to half of the radius parameter of reconstructed jets.
 * 
 * Currently the plugin is not able to reapply JEC and neglects any systematic variations.
