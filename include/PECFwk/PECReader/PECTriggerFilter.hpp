 * The selection is described by a collection of TriggerRange objects. They must provide a valid
 * data trigger for each event in the dataset that will be processed; if the trigger corresponding
 * to a specific event is not found in the trigger tree, an exception is thrown.
 * 
 * Only necessary branches of the trigger tree are read. The GetWeight method only performs an
 * (optinal) event selection specified in the corresponding TriggerRange object; thus, the weight
 * returned is either 0. or 1.
