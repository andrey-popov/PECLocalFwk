/**
 * \class DatasetBuilder
 * \brief A class to automatize construction of datasets using a JSON file with descriptions
 * 
 * The purpose of this class is to relief user from typing in properties of datasets manually.
 * Instead they are read from a JSON file, and datasets to be constructed are identified simply by
 * their IDs. A list of IDs is given as input to method Build (or its shortcuts), and it produces
 * a list of fully constructed instances of class Dataset.
 * 
 * Input JSON file should have the following structure:
 * \code{.json}
 *   [
 *     {
 *       "datasetId": "SingleMuon-Run2016B_320_rjq",
 *       "files": ["SingleMuon-Run2016B_320_rjq.part*.root"],
 *       "isData": true
 *     },
 *     {
 *       "datasetId": "ttbar-pw_320_hFE",
 *       "files": ["ttbar-pw_320_hFE.part*.root"],
 *       "isData": false,
 *       "crossSection": 831.76,
 *       "eventsProcessed": 92925926,
 *       "meanWeight": 1.
 *     },
 *   ]
 * \endcode
 * The first entry is an example for experimental data, the second one is for simulation. Comments
 * are allowed.
 * 
 * Unless JSON file gives absolute paths for input files, they are resolved with respect to the
 * directory containing the JSON file or directory specified explicitly via SetBaseDirectory.
