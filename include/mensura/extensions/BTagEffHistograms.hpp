/**
 * \class BTagEffHistograms
 * \brief Fills histograms that can be used to calculate b-tagging efficiency
 * 
 * This plugin fills histograms with jet distributions in pt and |eta| for each dataset. The
 * histograms are filled for various jet flavours (b, c, other) with all jets in an event and jets
 * passing given working points of a b-tagger. These histograms can then be used to calculate
 * b-tagging efficiencies.
 * 
 * By default, the histograms have very fine binning. It is foreseen that bins will be merged when
 * the efficiencies are calculated.
 * 
 * The histograms are filled with nominal event weight read from a WeightCollector.
 * 
 * This plugin depends on a number of services and plugins: BTagWPService (default name "BTagWP"),
 * TFileService ("TFileService"), JetMETReader("JetMET"), WeightCollector("EventWeights").
