/**
 * \class EventCounter
 * \brief A class to fill a cut-flow table
 * 
 * An instance of the class allows to define several selection steps, each with an associated
 * counter and an optional list of event IDs. After the counters are filled, the cut-flow table is
 * written to the standard output and the lists of passed events are stored in a set of files (one
 * file for each selection step).
 * 
 * The class is not thread-safe. It is expected to be used for synchronisation only and not intended
 * to be exploited in a production version of a program. Given its transient usage, the foreseen way
 * to insert the class in the code is to make a global object in a dedicated branch. After the
 * synchronisation is over, the branch should be removed.
