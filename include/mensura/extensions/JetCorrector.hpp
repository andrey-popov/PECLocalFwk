/**
 * \class JetCorrector
 * \brief Computes jet energy and resolution corrections
 * 
 * This class computes jet corrections to adjust energy scale and resolution. Inputs for the
 * computation are provided in form of standard text files used by JetMET POG. The computed
 * correction is returned as a factor to rescale jet four-momentum.
 * 
 * Any levels of the full correction can be omitted. If JEC text files are not provided, jet
 * momentum is assumed to be corrected for the energy scale. Otherwise the corresponding correction
 * is evaluated starting from raw jet momentum (which thus must have been set up properly). If one
 * or more JEC uncertainties are specified by user and a JEC systematic variation is requested,
 * the correction factor is adjusted accordingly. If JER data/MC scale factors have been specified,
 * deterministic JER smearing is applied for jets that have matched generator-level jets. If pt
 * resolution in simulation is specified in addition, jets that do not have generator-level matches
 * are smeared stochastically using this resolution and the scale factors.
