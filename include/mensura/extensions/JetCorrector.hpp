 * \class JetCorrector
 * \brief Applies JEC and performs JER smearing

 * \warining This class is undergoing a heavy modification. Most of its documentation has not been
 * updated.
 * 
 * The only mandator action is an application of JEC. If required data files are provided, performs
 * JER smearing and, if requested explicitly, evaluates JEC or JER systematical variations. Note
 * that JER smearing is applied for the nominal state as well while the JER systematics controls the
 * amount of smearing.
