/**
 * \class JetCorrectorService
 * \brief A service that computes jet energy and resolution corrections
 * 
 * This class computes jet corrections to adjust energy scale and resolution. Inputs for the
 * computation are provided in form of standard text files used by JetMET POG. The computed
 * correction is returned as a factor to rescale jet four-momentum.
 * 
 * Intervals of validity (IOVs) in terms of run ranges are supported. User must register all IOVs
 * with method RegisterIOV and provide JERC parameters for each of them using methods
 * SetJEC, SetJECUncertainty, and SetJER. Before jet corrections can be evaluated, the appropriate
 * IOV must be chosen with SelectIOV.
 * 
 * Alternatively, it is possible to use a single match-all IOV. It does not need to be registered,
 * and there are dedicated versions of methods to provide JERC parameters. There is also no need to
 * call for SelectIOV in that case.
 * 
 * Any levels of the full correction can be omitted. If JEC text files are not provided, jet
 * momentum is assumed to be corrected for the energy scale. Otherwise the corresponding correction
 * is evaluated starting from raw jet momentum (which thus must have been set up properly). If one
 * or more JEC uncertainties are specified by user and a JEC systematic variation is requested,
 * the correction factor is adjusted accordingly. If JER data/MC scale factors have been specified,
 * deterministic JER smearing is applied for jets that have matched generator-level jets. If pt
 * resolution in simulation is specified in addition, jets that do not have generator-level matches
 * are smeared stochastically using this resolution and the scale factors.
