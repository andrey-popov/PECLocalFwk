 * \class BTagWeightCSVShape

 * The reweighting is intended to reproduce full shapes of the CSV b-tagging discriminators. Its
 * idea is described in CMS AN-13-130. In the current implementation systematic uncertainties are
 * ignored.
 * 
 * This plugin exploits a JetReader with a default name "JetMET".
