/**
 * \class PileUpWeight
 * \brief Plugin that implements reweighting for additional pp interactions ("pile-up")
 * 
 * This plugin performs reweighting on pile-up based on the expected number of pile-up
 * interactions, or the "true" simulated pile-up. The idea follows the official recipe [1].
 * 
 * Inputs needed for the reweighting are the target (data) distribution of pile-up (normally it is
 * constructed with the help of script pileupCalc.py [2]), the pile-up profile used in simulation,
 * and the desired systematic variation as described in [3]. It is possible to provide individual
 * simulated profile for every process, although usually a common one would suffice.
 * 
 * This plugin exploits a PileUpReader with the default name "PileUp".
