/**
 * \class BTagSFService
 * \brief Service to retrieve b-tagging scale factors
 * 
 * This service reads b-tagging scale factor from standard CSV files. It interfaces code provided
 * by BTV POG [1], which is included as the package external/BTagCalibration.
 * 
 * A single instance of this service retrives scale factors for a single b-tagging configuration
 * (i.e. algorithm and working point). After an instance is created, the user must specify with the
 * method SetMeasurement which "measurements" should be used for which jet flavours.
 * 
 * All objects from external/BTagCalibration are shared among all clones of this service. They are
 * believed to be thread-safe.
