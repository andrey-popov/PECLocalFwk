/**
 * \class EventIDFilter
 * \brief Filters events based on their ID
 * 
 * This plugin filters events based on their ID (run, lumi, event numbers). The user specifies a
 * list of event IDs in a text file, and the plugin either keeps or rejects events whose IDs are
 * found in the list.
 * 
 * The file should have the following format. First, it identifies the dataset to which provided
 * event IDs correpond. This is done with line "Dataset: <ID>", where by default <ID> is the unique
 * label of the source dataset, as given by Dataset::GetSourceDatasetID(). Alternatively, the
 * plugin can be configured to use name of the first file in the dataset, see documentation for
 * method SetUseFileName. After the dataset ID, a list of event IDs is provided in the format
 * <run>:<lumi>:<event>, one per line. Entries for as many datasets as needed can be provided in
 * the input file. Empty lines can be inserted anywhere. Comments starting with symbol '#' are
 * ignored.
 * 
 * The filter relies on the presence of a EventIDReader with a default name "InputData".
 * 
 * \warning The class can filter atomic datasets only (i.e. ones that contain a single file).
