/**
 * \class LeptonSFWeight
 * \brief A plugin to reweight events to account for lepton scale factors
 * 
 * Only leptons of one selected flavour are considered in the computation. If more than one lepton
 * of that flavour are found, their scale factors are multiplied together.
 * 
 * Scale factors are stored in a ROOT file in the form of one or more two-dimensional histograms.
 * Meaning of x and y parameters of each histogram can be specified with a TObjString written in
 * the file. It must have the same name as the histogram, with a postfix "__params" added. The
 * parameter string must be composed of labels defining x and y parameters, separated by a
 * semicolon, for instance "pt;absEta". Following labels are supported: "pt", "eta", "etaSC",
 * "absEta", "absEtaSC". It no parameter string is found, transverse momentum and (signed)
 * pseudorapidity of the lepton are taken parameters of the histogram.
 * 
 * Errors of provided scale factors are summed up in quadrature, producing a single systematic
 * variation.
