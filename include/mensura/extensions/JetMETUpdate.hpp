/**
 * \class JetMETUpdate
 * \brief A plugin that applies energy corrections to jets and propagates them into MET
 * 
 * This plugin reads jets and MET provided by a JetMETReader with a default name "OrigJetMET" and
 * reapplies jet corrections, propagating them also into MET.
 * 
 * T1 MET corrections are evaluated approximately. The plugin starts from the provided MET (with
 * outdated corrections applied), undoes T1 corrections using only jets available from the source
 * JetMETReader (thus, they are usually cleaned against leptons and have physics ID applied) that
 * are additionally required to pass a selection on recorrected transverse momentum (by default,
 * pt > 15 GeV), and applies new T1 corrections computed with the same jets. If soft jets are not
 * saved in input files and thus are not available through the source JetMETReader, they will
 * contrubute to T1 MET corrections as they were at the time of computation of the original MET,
 * i.e. with outdated corrections. If stochastic JER corrections have been used in computation of
 * MET, they can only be undone on the average due to their random nature.
 * 
 * It is also possible to start computation from the raw MET rather than default one. In this case
 * T1 corrections can be applied directly.
 * 
 * The source MET can have any additive corrections applied. They will be preserved by this plugin.
