/**
 * \class Service
 * \brief Abstract base class for services
 * 
 * This class provides an interface to access information that is only updated once per dataset or
 * not updated at all (as opposed to plugins that are designed to operate on the per-event basis).
 * It keeps the pointer to the Processor class that owns services, which allows to access other
 * services if needed.
 * 
 * A service is notified when processing of a dataset starts or finishes with the help of the
 * dedicated hooks. Depending on the logic, it might or might not take action in response to these
 * events.
 * 
 * A service must implement method Clone that creates a newly initialized copy of it. The clonning
 * is performed by the framework before the start of processing of the first dataset, and thus it
 * must not address any internal state specific to a dataset. Often it might be advantageous to
 * share resources between all clones of a service.
 * 
 * A service must be capable of working in a multi-thread environment. In particular, a special
 * attention should be given to ROOT objects as ROOT is not thread-safe. Critical blocks must be
 * guarded with the help of class ROOTLock.
 * 
 * A service must define a valid move constructor.
