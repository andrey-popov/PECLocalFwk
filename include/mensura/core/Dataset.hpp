/**
 * \class Dataset
 * \brief A class to store information about a dataset
 * 
 * This class aggregates all basic properties of a dataset, most notably it contains a list of
 * input ROOT files together with information needed for normalization of simulated datasets
 * (cross sections, total numbers of processed events, and mean weights). A flag distinguishing
 * between experimental data and simulation is also stored.
 * 
 * Each dataset must be assigned an arbitrary label that uniquely identifies the source dataset
 * from which the files were produced. Physics content of files within the same dataset or multiple
 * datasets with identical labels is the same. If user does not specify this label, referred to as
 * source dataset ID, it is deduced automatically from the name of the first input file.
 * 
 * User can add arbitrary boolean flags to provide additional information about the dataset to
 * custom plugins.
 * 
 * Currently a number of properties are described with enumerations Process, Generator, and
 * ShowerGenerator. This functionality is deprecated and will be eliminated in future.
