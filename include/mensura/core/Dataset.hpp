/**
 * \class Dataset
 * \brief A class to store information about a dataset
 * 
 * The class aggregates all relevant information about a dataset. It includes names of ROOT files,
 * corresponding cross sections and numbers of events in the parent datasets processed in Grid. It
 * also attaches one or more codes to specify physics process represendted by the dataset. If
 * several process codes are provided, they describe the process at different levels of
 * detalisation, e.g. ttbar and semileptonic ttbar; they are never strict synonyms. In addition,
 * information about generators of the hard process and the showering can be provided.
 * 
 * For each dataset a label is attached, which identifies uniquely the source dataset from which
 * the files were produced (usually, the dataset processed in Grid). Currently this label is set
 * automatically, and it coinsides with the base name of the first file in the dataset, with the
 * part number postfix stripped off.
 * 
 * The user can also define arbitrary boolean flags binded with an instance of the class. Their
 * usage is not restricted by the framework.
