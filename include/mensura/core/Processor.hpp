/**
 * \class Processor
 * \brief Runs plugins in a single thread
 * 
 * This class is responsible for execution of a collection of plugins, which is organized into an
 * ordered path. It allows each plugin to access other plugins in the path and services. Plugins
 * and services are owned by Processor, which also registers itself as their master.
 * 
 * Instances of this class are spanned by RunManager to process a queue of datasets. Each processor
 * is run in a separate thread. The entry point for execution is operator(). This class is a friend
 * of RunManager and profits from this to pop up datasets from the queue RunManager::datasets.
 * 
 * It is also possible to run a Processor independently of a RunManager. In this case method
 * OpenDataset must be called before the event loop, and then each single event can be processed
 * with method ProcessEvent. The dataset as a whole can be processed using method ProcessDataset.
