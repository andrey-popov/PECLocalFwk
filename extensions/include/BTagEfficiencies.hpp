/**
 * \class BTagEfficiencies
 * \brief Accesses b-tagging efficiencies stored in a ROOT file
 * 
 * The class implements an access to b-tagging efficiencies in a generic way. The efficiencies are
 * stored in a ROOT file in the form of 2D histograms in jet transverse momentum and pseudorapidity.
 * Supported format of the file is described below.
 * 
 * The histograms are named following the pattern processLabel_flavour_workingPoint. Here
 * processLabel is an arbitrary label that helps to distinguish between histograms for different
 * processes. The label must not contain an underscore, which is reserved to separate parts of the
 * histogram name. The next fragment, flavour, takes on one of the following values: "b", "c",
 * "uds", "g"; jets with unidentified flavour (zero) should be assigned to the gluon category. The
 * last part denotes the working point of the b-tagging algorithm; its possible values are "T", "M",
 * and "L", as specified in method WorkingPointToText. The file format does not require that
 * histograms for all combinations of working points and jet flavours are present in the file.
 * 
 * The file can contain several alternative sets of histograms, for example, to describe different
 * versions of event selection. Each set must be placed in a dedicated in-file directory. The
 * directories can have arbitrary names.
 * 
 * The root directory of the file must contain a TObjString object with name "formatVersion". Its
 * title value encodes version of file format. The following values are supported at the moment:
 * "1.0".
 * 
 * The user creates an instance of the class providing a path to a ROOT file with b-tagging
 * efficiencies and an in-file path to a directory that contains the desired set of histograms. Then
 * the user must define with the help of method SetProcesslabel a desired mapping between process
 * codes assigned to datasets and process labels used to form histogram names. (S)he can also
 * specify a default process label to be used when no specific label is provided.
 * 
 * After this is done, b-tagging efficiencies for a given dataset can be loaded read with the method
 * LoadPayload and then accessed using GetEfficiency.
 * 
 * The class provides valid copy and move constructors. It is not thread-safe; however, the ROOT
 * file and histograms with b-tagging efficiences are safe be shared among several threads.
 * 
 * Consult documentation on the base class to get additional details about overriden methods.
