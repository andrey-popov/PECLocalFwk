/**
 * \class WeightPileUp
 * \brief An implementation for reweighting on additional pp interactions ("pile-up")
 * 
 * The class implements reweighting over pile-up based on the "true" number of pile-up interactions
 * (i.e. the parameter of Poisson distribution, from which the actual number of pile-up events is
 * sampled). The idea follows the official recipe [1].
 * [1] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PileupMCReweightingUtilities
 * 
 * The input parameters for the algorithm are a file with target (data) distribution over pile-up
 * (normally the file is created by script pileupCalc.py [2]) and an amount of scaling of the number
 * of pile-up interactions that is used to account for the systematical variation (as described in
 * [3]). Several times a random-number engine exploited to admix pile-up to MC has been
 * misconfigured, which made the actual pile-up distribution in MC deviate from the nominal one.
 * The class is capable of handling such cases and for this reason can accept the name of a ROOT
 * file with actual pile-up MC histograms, which are used instead of nominal one.
 * [2] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PileupJSONFileforData
 * [3] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PileupSystematicErrors
 * 
 * The nominal MC pile-up distribution used by default is S10 (adopted in Summer12 campaign).

     * of pile-up interactions. The file must contain a histogram named "pileup" that describes
     * the distribution. No assumption about binning of the histogram is made (the code works
     * with any one). The second parameter is the name of a file with MC distributions over the
     * "true" number of pile-up interactions before any event selection (it might differ from
     * the nominal distribution due to a bug in random-number engine). The both file names are
     * resolved w.r.t. directory $PEC_FWK_INSTALL/data/PileUp/. The last parameter is a
     * desired systematical variation as defined in [1].
