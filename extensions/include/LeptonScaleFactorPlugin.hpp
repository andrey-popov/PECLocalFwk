/**
 * \class LeptonScaleFactorPlugin
 * \brief A plugin to reweight events to account for lepton scale factors
 * 
 * The scale factors are provided as one or more 2D histograms, which encode dependence on lepton's
 * transverse momentum and signed (!) pseudorapidity. If several histograms are provided, scale
 * factors read from each of them are multiplied together. The user specifies which lepton flavour
 * is considered. If an event contains several leptons of that flavour (accessed through
 * PECReader::GetLeptons), the final event weight is a multiplication of scale factors for all of
 * the leptons.
 * 
 * Currently no systematic uncertainty is evaluated.
