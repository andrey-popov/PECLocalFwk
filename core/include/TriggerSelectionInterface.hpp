/**
 * \class TriggerSelectionInterface
 * \brief An abstract class to define interface for the trigger selection
 * 
 * The trigger selection is splitted into two steps represented by virtual methods PassTrigger and
 * GetWeight. At the first step the decision is taken based on the event ID and information stored
 * in the trigger tree. Normally, it would simply check if appropriate triggers accepted the event.
 * At the second step trigger scale factors are incorporated, and an additional selection that
 * exploits information on the whole event can be evaluated.
 * 
 * When a new dataset is opened, an instanse of this class must be notified with the help of method
 * UpdateTree. It is also given a pointer to the new trigger tree. The tree is not owned by the
 * object (normally, it is owned by an instance of the PECReader class), but all operations on it
 * must be carried in a class derived from this TriggerSelectionInterface. In particular, it implies
 * setting of setting addresses for the tree's branches and reading the tree.
 * 
 * Although a trigger selection is expected to be described by a set of TriggerRange objects, which
 * sets a tight connection between the two classes, it is not specified as a part of the interface
 * to provide the user with more flexibility.
 * 
 * If several instances of class PECReader are used simultaneously, each must operate on its own
 * copy of a class derived from TriggerSelectionInterface because it contains information specific
 * for the current file under processing. In order to allow such behaviour, a derived class must
 * provide an implementation for method Clone.
