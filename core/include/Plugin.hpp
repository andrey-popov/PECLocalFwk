/**
 * \class Plugin
 * \brief An abstract class to define a plugin to be used in class Processor
 * 
 * The class specifies a simple interface that allows to perform a certain processing for each event
 * in a dataset and, additionally, notify the plugin when processing of the dataset starts and
 * finishes. It contains a pointer to the parent Processor instance that can be used to access
 * other plugins attached to the same Processor.
 * 
 * A single plugin might be used to process several datasets, which requires certain initialization
 * and termination actions to be performed in BeginRun/EndRun methods in case of non-trivial
 * plugins. The pointer to the parent Processor instance is initialized before processing of the
 * first dataset starts and is expected to be valid during the lifetime of the plugin.
 * 
 * A derived class might or might not be copyable, but it must implement a method to clone an
 * instance. The clonning must address only configuration of the processing algorithm but not data
 * members specific for a dataset or an event (e.g. handlers of output files). Such a functionality
 * is required to multiplicate the plugin structure for each thread represented by class Processor.
 * 
 * A derived class must be capable of working in a multi-thread mode. The user should pay attention
 * to the fact that ROOT is not thread-safe. For this reason all the critical blocks (which include,
 * for example, creation of any ROOT objects) must be guarded with the help of class ROOTLock.
 * 
 * A derived class must define a valid move constructor.
 * 
 * The user is not advised to inherit directly from this class but use classes ReaderPlugin and
 * AnalysisPlugin instead.
