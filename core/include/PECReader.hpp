/**
 * \class PECReader
 * \brief Class to read files in PlainEventContent (PEC) format
 * 
 * This is the core class of the package. It reads a set of files in PEC format [1] as specified by
 * an instance of class Dataset. It performs an event selection requested by the user with the help
 * of instances of classes TriggerSelectionInterface and EventSelectionInterface. For each event the
 * user is provided a set of collections of different physics objects form the event; the objects
 * are represented by dedicated classes described in module PhysicsObjects.
 * [1] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PlainEventContentTuples
 * 
 * In case of simulated events, reweighting for b-tagging scale factors and pile-up is also
 * performed with the help of dedicated classes.
 * 
 * Both trigger-bit and event selection as well as reweighting for b-tagging and pile-up are not
 * mandatory. If one of these modules is not provided, the class prints a warning and falls back to
 * a reasonable default behaviour.
 * 
 * The user can configure an instance of class PECReader using methods that modify one parameter at
 * a time or provide a complete (or partial) configuration described in an instance of class
 * PECReaderConfig. An instance of PECReader does not own the configuration parameters.
 * 
 * Quality criteria to identify physics objects are hard-coded in the class and are not expected to
 * be accessed by the user; instead, they are fixed to CMS-wide recommendations.
 * 
 * The class is non-copyable. No move constructor is implemented.
