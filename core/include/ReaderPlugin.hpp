/**
 * \class ReaderPlugin
 * \brief Abstract base class for reader plugins
 * 
 * Compared to the base class Plugin, here a specific logic to interpret boolean decision issued by
 * ProcessEvent method is implemented. The decision is treated as an indication of a succeful
 * reading. If the value is false, it means that there are events left in the input dataset, and
 * therefore the parent Processor must terminate the event loop and proceed to the next dataset.
 * 
 * Consult documentation for the base class. In particular, in a derived class user must implement
 * methods Clone and ProcessEvent.
