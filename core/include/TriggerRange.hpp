/**
 * \class TriggerRange
 * \brief An aggregate to store trigger-related information
 * 
 * This class puts together relevant information for a trigger selection in a given data-taking
 * period. In addition to the name of the trigger used in specified EventID range in data and
 * the corresponding integrated luminosity, it contains the name of the corresponding MC trigger
 * and an optional modification of the offline event selection (useful if some triggers have higher
 * thresholds, for example).
 * 
 * The class is used solely to aggregate the information together and to simply access to it, it
 * shall not describe algorithms to exploit this information, for example, to perform the actual
 * trigger selection or to calculate the MC event weight due to the triggers.
 * 
 * The class is copyable.
